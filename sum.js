const args = process.argv.slice(2);

const num1 = parseFloat(args[0]);
const num2 = parseFloat(args[1]);

function sum(num1, num2) {
  let result = 0;
  result = num1 + num2;
  return result;
}

const total = sum(num1, num2);

console.log(total);

//Great job on your code! It's clean, well-structured, and easy to understand. You've correctly used process.argv.slice(2) to get the command line arguments, and you've also correctly converted the arguments to numbers using parseFloat(). Your sum function is simple and does exactly what it's supposed to do.

//Here are a few suggestions to make your code even better:

//Variable Initialization: In your sum function, you initialize result to 0 and then immediately assign it a new value. This is unnecessary. You can directly assign the sum of num1 and num2 to result. Like this:
function sum(num1, num2) {
  let result = num1 + num2;
  return result;
}
//Error Handling: Your code currently doesn't handle the case where the user doesn't provide two arguments, or where the arguments can't be converted to numbers. Adding some error handling would make your code more robust. Here's an example of how you could do this:
if (args.length !== 2 || isNaN(num1) || isNaN(num2)) {
  console.error('Please provide exactly two numbers.');
  process.exit(1);
}
//Simplify the sum function: Since your sum function is quite simple, you could return the result directly without storing it in a variable. Like this:
function sum(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}
/*Use const instead of let for result: Since you're not reassigning result, you could declare it with const instead of let. This makes it clear that result is not supposed to be reassigned.
Remember, these are just suggestions for improvement. Your code is already quite good! Keep up the good work.
